				<p style="color: #502920;text-align: center;">Embracing our Swiss culinary heritage and working exclusively with sustainable Swiss grand cru chocolate, we produce all products freshly and in small batches on the California coast. Our team works with the world's most sustainable Swiss vendors to source the highest-grade materials for our products. These vendors pay their cacao suppliers above-average prices to grow, harvest and process the purest chocolate you can find. Once it reaches DENSE, our Swiss-trained chocolatiers use it to create our ever-evolving suite of confections, so you can enjoy them with a happy heart.</p>
