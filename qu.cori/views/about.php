					<h2>Cori Qu</h2>
					<p>Hi there! I'm Cori who on Instagram as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coriq_/">@coriq_</a>. I was born and raised in Beijing and currently living in San Francisco. Photography for me is probably a lifetime hobby, and I work as a freelance photographer parttime. I love traveling, exploring and meeting new people. Previously I was working and traveling in Sydney for months and have laid footprints in a couple of cities in China. And more adventures are gonna coming soon. ;p</p>
