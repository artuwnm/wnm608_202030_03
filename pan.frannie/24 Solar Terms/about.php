		    <p>Ancient Chinese divided the circle of the annual motion of the sun into 24 equal segments; each segment was called a “jie qi”of solar term. Hence the 24 segments are collectively called the Twenty-four Solar Terms. This system of time embodies traditional knowledge and social practices based on the perception of the regularity of seasons, astronomical laws and other local natural phenomena occurring in the course of the year. It provides guidance for Chinese on organizing agricultural activities and daily life. It is an indispensable component of the traditional Chinese calendrics and its living applications, and functions as an important carrier of the Chinese cultural identity.
		    </p>

		    <p>Being a specific knowledge continuum of time, the Twenty-four Solar Term has been transmitted through generations and profoundly influenced Chinese people's way of thinking and code of conduct. Upon each solar term, people spontaneously arrange farming and daily routine as well as basic necessities of life. It is thus sustained through a variety of ritual practices and folk activities.
