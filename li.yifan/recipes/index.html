		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>1 pound penne pasta</p>
		<p>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</p>
		<p>2 cloves garlic, finely grated</p>
		<p>3 cups heavy cream</p>
		<p>2 cups finely grated Parmesan</p>
		<p>2 cups chopped cooked white meat chicken (from 1 rotisserie chicken)</p>
		<p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
		<p>2 large red heirloom beefsteak tomatoes, sliced 1/4 inch thick</p>
		<p>1 pound fresh salted mozzarella, sliced 1/4 inch thick</p>
		<p>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
		<p>1/2 cup torn fresh basil leaves</p>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<p>1. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.</p>

		<p>2. Cook the pasta to al dente according to the package directions. (Reserve some pasta water to add back in case the dish needs moisture.)</p>

		<p>3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the cream and Parmesan and cook, stirring frequently until the mixture begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and carefully toss to completely coat, then continue to cook until the mixture is smooth and thick, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Carefully stir until the butter is completely melted and the sauce is glossy and creamy; remove from the heat. </p>

		<p>4. Alternating 1 slice of tomato and 1 slice of mozzarella, shingle around the outer edge of the skillet creating a ring that covers the pasta. Repeat with the remaining tomato and mozzarella forming smaller concentric rings until the pasta is completely covered. Drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle with some salt and bake until the mozzarella is beginning to melt but the slices still hold their shape and are still white, about 20 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then top with the basil and serve.</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</p>
		<p>4 cloves garlic, sliced</p>
		<p>1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, diced</p>
		<p>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil and/or parsley, plus more for garnish</p>
		<p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
		<p>1 cup ricotta cheese</p>
		<p>1 large egg</p>
		<p>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish</p>
		<p>6 sheets no-bake lasagna noodles</p>
		<p>1 carrot, peeled into ribbons</p>
		<p>1 zucchini, peeled into ribbons</p>
		<p>3 1/2 cups baby spinach</p>
		<p>1/3 pound mozzarella , thinly sliced</p>
		
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<p>1. Heat the 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic; cook, stirring, until golden, 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of the herbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste; cook until saucy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender and carefully blend until smooth (see Cook's Note). Return 1 cup of the sauce to the skillet and reduce the heat to low; reserve the remaining sauce.</p>

		<p>2. Meanwhile, combine the ricotta, egg, Parmesan, the remaining 3 tablespoons herbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a medium bowl.</p>

		<p>3. Place 2 lasagna noodles over the sauce in the skillet. Layer half of the carrots and zucchini on top; drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cover with half of the spinach, half of the ricotta mixture, a few pieces of mozzarella and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the reserved tomato sauce. Repeat the layers, ending with noodles. Top with the remaining sauce and mozzarella. Cover and simmer until the lasagna is cooked and the mozzarella melts, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>

		<p>4. Let rest for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with more Parmesan and fresh herbs.</p>
